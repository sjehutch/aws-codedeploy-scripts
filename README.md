## aws-codedeploy-scripts

*Active development is done on the `develop` branch of this repository.*

This repository includes a set of re-useable scripts, that are ment to be
used in conjunction with AWS CodeDeploy. These scripts can be included in a
project as a git submodule for example. They expect a 'aws-codedeploy-vars.sh' file
to be available at the project root, which they will source.

See `aws_codedeploy_variables.sh.example` file in this repository for the variables supported.
